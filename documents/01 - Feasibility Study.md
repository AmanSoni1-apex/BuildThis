# Feasibility Study: Problem Discovery Platform

## Executive Summary

**Current Working Name:** ProblemOcean

**Core Concept:** A crowd-sourced repository of real-world software problems (NOT solutions) for developers to discover, build, and solve.

**Value Proposition:** Solves the #1 question developers ask: "What should I build?"

**Target Audience:** 
- Developers seeking project ideas
- Students looking for hackathon inspiration  
- Indie hackers validating startup concepts
- Portfolio builders

**Verdict:** ✅ **HIGHLY VIABLE** - Strong market demand, clear differentiation, technical feasibility confirmed

---

## 1. Market Validation

### 1.1 The Problem is REAL

Our research confirms developers face a critical challenge:

> **"What should I build?"** is one of the most frequently asked questions in developer communities

**Evidence:**
- Reddit's r/learnprogramming, r/webdev, r/SideProject are filled with this question daily
- Existing platforms like GitHub's "app-ideas" repository has **70K+ stars**
- Multiple blogs/videos dedicated to "project ideas" get massive traffic
- Developers repeatedly cite "finding ideas" as harder than "building"

### 1.2 Market Size

**Primary Market:**
- 28+ million developers worldwide (GitHub, 2023)
- Growing at ~500K new developers/year
- Side project culture is exploding (IndieHackers, ProductHunt communities)

**Engagement Indicators:**
- "app ideas" searches: High volume on Google Trends
- Project idea platforms get 100K+ monthly visitors
- Developer communities have millions of active users

### 1.3 User Pain Points

From Reddit/community analysis:

| Pain Point | Frequency | Quote Example |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Lack of inspiration** | Very High | "I know how to code, not what to code" |
| **Generic tutorial projects** | High | "Tired of building todo apps" |
| **No real-world context** | High | "Want to solve actual problems" |
| **Solution-focused resources** | Medium | "LeetCode teaches algorithms, not problem discovery" |

---

## 2. Competitive Analysis

### 2.1 Existing Solutions

| Platform | Type | What They Do | Gap/Limitation |
|----------|------|--------------|----------------|
| **GitHub: florinpop17/app-ideas** | Static Repository | List of 100+ app ideas with user stories | ❌ No community voting<br>❌ No search/filter<br>❌ Not real-world problems<br>❌ Static, not dynamic |
| **DevProjects (CodeMentor)** | Curated Projects | Senior devs create project specs | ❌ Solution-focused<br>❌ Limited quantity<br>❌ Not crowd-sourced |
| **Reddit (r/SideProject)** | Forum | Discussions, sharing | ❌ Not organized<br>❌ No discovery system<br>❌ Mixed with solutions |
| **Hacker News** | News/Discussion | Tech discussions | ❌ Not problem-focused<br>❌ No categorization |
| **LeetCode/CodeWars** | Coding Challenges | Algorithm practice | ❌ Not real-world problems<br>❌ Not for building products |
| **ProductHunt** | Product Launch | Showcase finished products | ❌ Shows solutions, not problems |
| **IndieHackers** | Community | Founders share revenue/strategy | ❌ Success stories, not raw problems |

### 2.2 What's Missing in Existing Platforms

**Critical Gap Identified:**

The most popular existing resource (GitHub's "florinpop17/app-ideas" with 70K+ stars) provides **practice exercises**, NOT **real-world problems**.

**Examples from app-ideas repo:**
- ❌ "Build a countdown timer"
- ❌ "Build a quiz app"  
- ❌ "Build a notes app"
- ❌ "Build a calculator"

**Nobody wakes up thinking:** "I desperately need another countdown timer app!"

These are tutorials, not problems that need solving.

**What YOUR platform will have instead:**
- ✅ "Street food vendors can't accept digital payments easily"
- ✅ "Apartment buildings lack systems for booking shared amenities"
- ✅ "Freelance designers waste hours creating invoices manually"
- ✅ "Local libraries can't notify readers when books are available"
- ✅ "Small gyms struggle to manage class bookings via WhatsApp"

**The difference:**
- **Their problems:** "What tutorial should I follow?"
- **Your problems:** "What real pain should I solve?"

### 2.3 Your Competitive Advantage

**What Makes Your Platform UNIQUE:**

✅ **ONLY problems, NO solutions** - Crystal clear focus  
✅ **Crowd-sourced** - Real problems from real people  
✅ **Discovery-focused** - Search, filter, categorize  
✅ **Voting system** - Surface best problems  
✅ **Bookmark feature** - Personal problem library  
✅ **Real-world context** - Who's affected, why it matters  
✅ **Genuine impact** - Build things people actually need, not practice projects

**Market Gap:**
> There is NO dedicated platform that exclusively curates and organizes **REAL-WORLD problems** (not practice exercises) for developers to discover and build solutions for.

**Quality Bar:**
Every problem on your platform must pass the test:  
*"Would solving this actually help real people?"*

If the answer is "It's just practice" → reject it.  
If the answer is "Yes, people need this" → approve it.

## 3. Technical Feasibility

### 3.1 MVP Architecture

**Frontend:**
- Framework: React/Next.js or Vue/Nuxt
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: Vercel/Netlify

**Backend:**
- Option A: Node.js/Express + MongoDB
- Option B: Spring Boot + PostgreSQL (you have experience)
- Option C: Supabase (fastest, managed backend)

**Core Features for v0.1 (MVP):**
- ✅ User registration/login
- ✅ Submit a problem
- ✅ Browse problems (list view)
- ✅ Filter by category

- ✅ Bookmark problems

### 3.2 Database Schema (Simple)

```
Users:
- id, username, email, password_hash, created_at

Problems:
- id, title, description, category, created_by (user_id), created_at, upvotes_count

Votes:
- id, user_id, problem_id, created_at

Bookmarks:
- id, user_id, problem_id, created_at

Categories:
- id, name, description
```

### 3.3 Complexity Assessment

| Component | Complexity | Time Estimate |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Authentication | Low-Medium | 1-2 days |
| Problem CRUD | Low | 1 day |
| Voting System | Low | 1 day |
| Bookmark System | Low | 0.5 day |
